I just released taileater, a puzzle game that I have been working on for the last month. It can be played for free [here](https://szunami.itch.io/taileater)

I have also released the source code for it [here](https://github.com/szunami/taileater/), if that is your thing.

Many thanks to my lovely girlfriend Charlotte for offering a ton of helpful feedback and support.

I am planning on writing two more posts that where I talk about lessons learned and get a bit into the weeds of tech stuff.
