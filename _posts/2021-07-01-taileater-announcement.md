I just released taileater, a puzzle game that I have been working on for the last month. It can be played for free [here](https://szunami.itch.io/taileater)

I have also released the source code for it [here](https://github.com/szunami/taileater/), if that is your thing.

Many thanks to my lovely girlfriend Charlotte for offering invaluable feedback and support. Many thanks also to TheRawMeatball, Francois, [@alice_i_cecile](https://twitter.com/aliceicecile) and everyone in the [Bevy engine help discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/742884593551802431). [Francois' post](https://vleue.com/2020/12/bevmnist/#github-actions-to-deploy-to-itchio) about using Github Actions to deploy bevy projects to itch.io proved especially useful.

I am planning on writing two more posts that where I talk about lessons learned and get a bit into the weeds of tech stuff, but that's all for now.
