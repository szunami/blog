Last week I made [squirtle](https://github.com/szunami/squirtle), a small tool to play the [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). There is more detail in the repo, but in short it uses a standard word list to make efficient guesses.

One interesting outcome: on a blank board, what should you guess?
