For the last 9 months, pretty much every morning I have brewed coffee for myself and my girlfriend using a V60. My brew method is based on [James Hoffman's ultimate V60 technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4ynXzkSQo).

- Hario V60 Scale
- Hario Ceramic V60 Dripper
- Knock Aergrind Hand Grinder
